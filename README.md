hmud
====

A MUD in Haskell. At least, that's the goal; presently all I have here is just the beginnings of a one-player text adventure game.

To play the game on a Mac:

1. Download the Haskell Platform.

2. Run "runmefirst.sh".

3. From the parent directory of the "Mud" directory, type "runghc Mud/Main.hs".
